[Kitaev's Toric Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9707021v1) is defined on a $k \times k$ periodic square lattice with qubits on each edge ($2k^2$ qubits total); the stabilizer group is generated by the set of vertex operators $A_v$ and plaquette operators $B_p$, where we define 

$$ A_v \equiv \prod_{j\in v} X_j\ ;\ B_p \equiv \prod_{j\in p} Z_j. $$

The code space is determined by the set of states which are simultaneously $+1$ eigenstates of all the stabilizers. There are $2k^2-2$ independent stabilizers $(\prod_v A_v = \prod_p B_p = \mathbb{I})$ acting on a state of $2k^2$ qubits, so it can protect $2$ logical qubits of information. 

The logical operators on this code space are noncontractible Pauli strings of either $X$ operators along the dual lattice, or $Z$ operators along the lattice.  $Z$-loops about the vertical(horizontal) dimension count the number of $X$-loops around the horizontal(vertical) dimension that have acted on the logical $|00\rangle$ configuration.

This notebook demonstrates how one can initialize a set of $2k^2$ qubits into the logical ground state of the Toric Code, then use logical operations to prepare any logical state. With this, one can then simulate a random Pauli error channel on the data qubits, measure the stabilizers, and apply Pauli strings to remove the defects and recover the correct logical state.
